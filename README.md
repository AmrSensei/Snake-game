# Snake Game (Terminal-Based)
This is a simple Snake Game developed using C++, which runs in the system terminal. The game includes various features and customizations that enhance the gameplay experience. The objective is to control the snake (represented by 'O') and eat the fruit ('x') to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own tail


Features:
Dynamic Difficulty Levels : Choose between Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulty, which adjusts the game's speed.
Wall Behavior Options : Play with either wall collisions or wraparound walls, where the snake reappears on the opposite side of the screen if it hits a boundary.
Score Tracking : Displays the current score, as well as the highest score achieved during gameplay.
Game Over Logic : The game ends if the snake collides with its own tail or the wall (depending on the selected mode).
Smooth Gameplay : Handles user input for movement (WASD keys) and provides real-time rendering in the terminal for a classic gaming feel.
Controls :
W: Move up
A: Move left
S: Move down
D: Move right
P: Pause/Exit game
How to Play :
Choose your difficulty level (Easy, Normal, or Hard).
Decide whether you want walls to block the snake or allow it to pass through and appear on the opposite side.
Use WASD keys to control the snake's movement.
Try to eat as many fruits as possible to grow the snake and increase your score.
Avoid crashing into walls or the snake's own tail.
